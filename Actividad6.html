A Sudoku is a puzzle pastime where a <span class="formula">9 × 9</span> grid is presented divided in smaller <span class="formula">3 × 3</span> grids. Most of this grids spaces are blank, and others are filled with numbers between 1-9. The objective is to fill the blank squares so that there are no repeated numbers neither in the <span class="formula">3 × 3</span> grids nor in the <span class="formula">9 × 9</span> grids columns nor rows, as it can be seen in the Fig. <a class="Reference" href="#fig:Start-puzzle-(a)">1↓</a>.

<div class="Indented">
Finding the solution of a Sudoku game is a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The problem can be considered in some way as a mixing between the traveling salesman problem, where the shortest distance between a given list of cities must be found permuting the route that will be taken. A similar action must be done in the Sudoku’s <span class="formula">3 × 3</span> grid, rearranging the 9 numbers, thus in this case there is no function to be calculated. On the other hand, it recalls the eight queens problem, which have to be placed in a chess table avoiding eating each other. In a similar way, the Sudoku row and columns can’t have the same number two or more times.
</div>
<h1 class="Section">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-2">2</a> Constraint handling
</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
Resolving a CSP with Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) requires transforming the original problem into a constrained optimization problem (COP). There are several ways for achieving this. The next list shows the most common ones <span class="bibcites">[<a class="bibliocite" name="cite-1" href="#biblio-1"><span class="bib-index">1</span></a>]</span>:
</div>
<ol>
<li>
A function is applied to the result so that infeasible solutions are penalized and their fitness is reduced. Usually the penalization is proportional to the number of violated constraints.
</li>
<li>
&ldquo;Repair&rdquo; a unfeasible solution returning a feasible one.
</li>
<li>
Ensure the feasibility of all solutions via a specific representation for the problem, as initialization, mutation and recombination.
</li>
<li>
Use a &ldquo;decoder&rdquo; from genotypes to phenotypes so that the last ones are always feasible.
</li>

</ol>
<div class="Unindented">
The penalty function that will be used counts how many numbers are repeated in each row and column, or, to express it in another way, how many numbers are missing. Mathematically it can be expressed like <span class="bibcites">[<a class="bibliocite" name="cite-4" href="#biblio-4"><span class="bib-index">4</span></a>]</span>:\begin_inset Separator latexpar\end_inset
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<h1 class="Section">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-3">3</a> Evolutionary Algorithm selection
</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
This problem is well suited to be resolved using Genetic Algorithms, as we want to find an optimal solution searching in a solution space <span class="bibcites">[<a class="bibliocite" name="cite-6" href="#biblio-6"><span class="bib-index">6</span></a>]</span>. In this kind of EA the genes of the individuals evolve similarly to how evolution works in nature, selecting the fittest parents which will create offspring individuals. This will mutate with some probability optimizing their solution, so that every generation will be closer to the exact solution.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.1">3.1</a> Representation
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
The genes chosen for this problem will represent the <span class="formula">9 × 9</span> through an integer array, although virtually the grid is divided into smaller <span class="formula">3 × 3</span> grids, so there will be 9 <span class="formula">3 × 3</span> arrays. Each of them will be a permutation representation as this is the operation that will create new different solutions.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
There will be two ways for accessing the grid: an absolute one, where the used form is [9][9], and another one, where each sub-grid will be located in a [3][3] position in the grid, as can be seen in Fig. <a class="Reference" href="#fig:-sub-arrays">2↓</a>.
</div>
<div class="Indented">

</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
To maintain the fixed numbers that are given as input to the puzzle through mutation, recombination and initialization, they are converted into negative values. Therefor calculations are made with absolute values.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.2">3.2</a> Evaluation
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
As showed in formula <a class="Reference" href="#eq:1">1↑</a>, the evaluation will count how many numbers are repeated in each row and column, and the sum will be the individual’s fitness. Logically, if a solution is found there will be no duplicates and the fitness will sum zero, so this is an inverse fitness optimization problem where the main goal will be to reach zero.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.3">3.3</a> Recombination
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
There are four different recombination operators for permutation representations that have been used so far <span class="bibcites">[<a class="bibliocite" name="cite-1" href="#biblio-1"><span class="bib-index">1</span></a>]</span>:
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Partially Mapped Crossover
</li>
<li>
Edge Crossover
</li>
<li>
Order Crossover
</li>
<li>
Cycle Crossover
</li>

</ol>
<div class="Unindented">
The two last ones are not applicable for the Sudoku problem because the order is not relevant, nor it is the absolute position. On the other hand, it has been verified that cycle crossover has worst properties of locality <span class="bibcites">[<a class="bibliocite" name="cite-2" href="#biblio-2"><span class="bib-index">2</span></a>]</span>. Sudoku represents a special case from a permutation point of view, due to the fact that preserving order or relative position does not have better results because of the interdependency between sub-grids. Therefor the permutation operator introduced by Sato <span class="bibcites">[<a class="bibliocite" name="cite-3" href="#biblio-3"><span class="bib-index">3</span></a>]</span> will be used, where crossover is done based on rows for the first child and based on columns for the second. In each case, the fittest row or column from both parents will be selected preserving highly fit results, as it can be seen in Fig. <a class="Reference" href="#fig:Sato's-row-and">3↓</a>. It must be noted that this rows and columns refer to the sub-grids, meaning that each position is a <span class="formula">3 × 3</span> grid, and the related fitness is the sum of fitness in groups of three rows or columns.

<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.4">3.4</a> Mutation
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
There are also four mutation types which can be selected when permutation is used: Swap, insert, scramble and inversion. For the current problem, the only feasible option is the swap operator as it is the only one that does not alter significantly the so far obtained results, because it changes only two positions.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
It must be noted that the mutation probability will affect each <span class="formula">3 × 3</span> grid separately, so for an individual the total probability of having a change in its numbers is nine times bigger.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.5">3.5</a> Parent Selection
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
The simplest parent selection method is the fitness proportional selection. However, this approach suffers from some problems like premature convergence or more sensitivity to outlying fitness values which can cause that a very fit individual dominates the intermediate population and reduces diversity <span class="bibcites">[<a class="bibliocite" name="cite-5" href="#biblio-5"><span class="bib-index">5</span></a>]</span>, so the alternative ranking selection will be used, in order to distribute selection probability more adequately.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The selection probability will be implemented with the roulette wheel algorithm. Tournament selection is dismissed because there is no problem to have knowledge of the entire population.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.6">3.6</a> Replacement

<div class="Unindented">
For survival selection, elitism will be used to preserve the current fittest members, but any other individual will be replaced by the offspring using age-based replacement.

<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-4.1">4.1</a> Mutation rate, dynamic vs. fixed
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Tests have been made to determine if a dynamic mutation rate (MR) approach, based on the main population fitness, is better than having a fixed rate that does not vary along the execution generations. The formula that has been used for changing the mutation rate is a simple one, which selects the minimum between 0.90 and a constant divided by the mean fitness. This minimum has been introduced to avoid endless loops in case that the mutation rate goes above 1.0.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="formula">
<a class="eqnumber" name="eq-2">(2) </a><i>ρ</i>’ = <i>min</i>[0.90,  <i>α</i><i>n</i> ⁄ <span class="limits"><sup class="limit"><i>n</i></sup><span class="limit">⎲</span><span class="limit">⎳</span><sub class="limit"><i>i</i> = 0</sub></span><i>f</i>(<i>x</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>)]
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
where <span class="formula"><i>f</i>(<i>x</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>)</span> stands for the fitness of the individual i.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Different values for <span class="formula"><i>α</i></span> have been tried: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. For the fixed MR, values 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30 and 0.40 have been used. However, the performance obtained with 0.40 was so poor that it has been discarded in order to not alter the graphics scale.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The obtained results show clearly that the best results are obtained using a fixed MR, as it can be seen in the next analysis. The data were obtained after performing 50 executions for each type of MR, with a 3000 members population, 500 parents through 1000 generations.

There are two groups that can be considered as the best.

To study how the population count affects to the results, some test have been made with 100, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000 and 20000 individuals populations. Again, 50 executions through 1000 generations have been done, using the fixed mutation rate of 0.30 obtained in the previous section. This time, the parents count used was 50 for the 1000 individuals population, 250 for 500 and 500 parents above that number. The execution time for each test has increased with the population, as can be seen in the next table:

It can be seen that the needed time increases as the population gets bigger, but there is little difference between the 5000 population and the 10000 one, compared with the 20000 individuals population. This can be explained considering that as the program breaks the search if a solution is found, when the success rate increases, less time is needed for that execution. This, together with the similar SR for the biggest populations (46% for 10000 and 48% for 20000) explain this data.

It has a simple interface where the current and previous executions results can be monitored. It also allows to select the parameters configuration file and start the test choosing which Sudoku puzzle must be solved.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
For output, a name must be given to the current test, and all data will be written in a folder with the same name. This folder contains three files:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
Data_results_<i>test_name</i>.txt: this file contains the solution obtained in each execution, and the achieved fitness.
</li>
<li>
Fitness_results_<i>test_name</i>.txt: here the fitness results for each execution can be found, in CSV format.
</li>
<li>
Generations_results_<i>test_name</i>.txt: the same as above, but measured in generations needed to find the solution (or maximum allowed generations if none was found).

<div class="Unindented">
This is the main package, where the evolution motor resides. It is composed by two classes:
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--14"></a>Evolution
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
The main evolutionary algorithm is located here, with the usual steps:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
Initialization
</li>
<li>
Evaluation
</li>
<li>
Parent selection
</li>
<li>
Recombination
</li>
<li>
Mutation
</li>
<li>
Replacement
</li>

</ul>
<h3 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--15"></a>Parameters
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
This class reads the parameters from the configuration file, and stores them to be used by other classes.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-5.3">5.3</a> individual
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
It contains only a class, with the same name.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--16"></a>Individual
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
This is the representation of each individual member. The most important variables are a 9x9 array to store the individual’s solution, and an integer to represent its fitness.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-5.4">5.4</a> steps

<div class="Unindented">
This package extends every step from the evolutionary algorithm described above:

</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
Starting with a CSP, it has been transformed into a COP through constraint handling. After studying different representation, mutation rates and recombination techniques, an efficient approximation has been obtained where a optimum parameters setting allows solving different Sudoku puzzles with an acceptable performance.
